Coding a Chrome Extension to automate the process of requesting access to blocked web pages by the Techloq web filtering software installed on my computer

By default the user story includes eight steps:

User gets redirected to block page
1   Click on 'Request Access' button
2   Enter my password
3   Click 'Proceed' button
4   Click 'Page'/'Website'/'Category' button (In my case mostly 'Page')
5   Click 'Proceed' button
6   Click 'Temporary'/'Permanent' button (In my case mostly 'Permanent')
7   Click 'Request change' button
8   Refresh the page

The goal is to eliminate all of these steps. The extension should automatically run it all for me without even clicking on the extension icon.

Personal notes whilst working on the project:

ASK HELP AT THE NEXT CodeWith Meet-Up
Maybe try to collaborate with M Simon on this

> Up to problem: Input field not updating when entering password programatically

Problem to solve: How to ensure I await the next part to load before my code runs

Recreate the problem by making my own input field both as password and text and see if I have the same issues that can't enter data programatically

Create ENV file to be able to collaborate without sharing my password which wouldn't be of any use to anyone anyway

Upload to GitHub
