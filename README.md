Coding a Chrome Extension to automate the process of requesting access to blocked web pages by the Techloq web filtering software installed on my computer

By default the user story includes eight steps:

User gets redirected to block page
1   Click on 'Request Access' button
2   Enter my password
3   Click 'Proceed' button
4   Click 'Page'/'Website'/'Category' button (In my case mostly 'Page')
5   Click 'Proceed' button
6   Click 'Temporary'/'Permanent' button (In my case mostly 'Permanent')
7   Click 'Request change' button
8   Refresh the page

The goal is to eliminate all of these steps. The extension should automatically run it all for me without even clicking on the extension icon.
